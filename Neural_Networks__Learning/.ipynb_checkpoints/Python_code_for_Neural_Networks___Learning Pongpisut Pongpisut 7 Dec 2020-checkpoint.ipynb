Given a training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$, we will first run a “forward pass” to compute all the activations throughout the network, including the output value of the hypothesis $h_\\theta(x)$. Then, for each node $j$ in layer $l$, we would like to compute an “error term” $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ that measures how much that node was “responsible” for any errors in our output.\n",

For the hidden units, you will compute $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ based on a weighted average of the error terms of the nodes in layer $(l+1)$. In detail, here is the backpropagation algorithm (also depicted in the figure above). You should implement steps 1 to 4 in a loop that processes one example at a time. Concretely, you should implement a for-loop `for t in range(m)` and place steps 1-4 below inside the for-loop, with the $t^{th}$ iteration performing the calculation on the $t^{th}$ training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$. Step 5 will divide the accumulated gradients by $m$ to obtain the gradients for the neural network cost function.\n",

Perform a feedforward pass, computing the activations $(z^{(2)}, a^{(2)}, z^{(3)}, a^{(3)})$ for layers 2 and 3. Note that you need to add a `+1` term to ensure that the vectors of activations for layers $a^{(1)}$ and $a^{(2)}$ also include the bias unit.

Without regularization, it is possible for a neural network to “overfit” a training set so that it obtains close to 100% accuracy on the training set but does not as well on new examples that it has not seen before.
