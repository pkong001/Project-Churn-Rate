## Machine Learning for Predicting Churn Rate
The project is the part of Master Degree at Chulalongkorn University Thailand

### background
In today telecommunication industry, there is a huge competition, on of the challenges in the telecommunication industry is the retention. Industry is struggling on maximizing profit from acquiring a new customer, which cost company a lot more when compare with retaining the existing customers; Therefore, for the company to increase it profitability.

### Problems
* Unpredictable churner tendency
* New Customers Cost is higher than retaining
* No insight of customers behavior

### Solutions / Approach
* Data Preparation
  * Separate data in to three sets
  * Type of data
  * Plot graph and seek basis descriptive math on our dataset
* Algorithm & Parameter
  * Choosing algorithm which we going to use in this study
  * Setting of parameters â€“ for each machine learning algorithm we are going to implement

* Test of algorithm
  * Diagnostic of result we acquire
